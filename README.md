# Shape-Blender
Spline Shape Blender 
# Process
For this project, I used Spline to create a 3D motion design. First, I watched several tutorial videos on how to make various motions and shapes. Then, I practiced and experimented with different types of motion. I finally settled on blending two spheres together. I changed the color, added a transition, and created an event to create the animation. 
# Users 
Anyone looking to learn about Spline and curious about what you can do.
# Learnings
Spline is a very complex program, but I discovered that I can do many things with it. Experimenting with Spine took lots of practice and learning. Ultimately, I am proud of the final result.
